# EpiBuffer: Spatially-Varying Buffer Radii Model for Estimating Spatial Heterogeneity in Exposure Buffers and Risk

This package implements a flexible hierarchical Bayesian spatial change points approach for modeling the effect of a spatially-varying exposure within some buffer distance of a location on an outcome. The approcah treats buffer radii as unknown parameters and allows both radii and exposure effects to vary spatially. The method relies on a spatially structured Gaussian process and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "EpiBuffer_Model_Details" and "EpiBuffer_Example" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
